      title: 'The Science Behind Pet Cloning',
      subtitle: `Pet cloning is a form of reproductive cloning that involves creating a new animal with the same DNA as an existing or deceased animal. The scientific process used is called somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT). Here's how it works, broken down into understandable steps.`,
      step1: {
        title: 'Somatic Cell Collection',
        subtitle: `It begins with a somatic cell, which is any cell from the body except sperm and egg cells. In pet cloning, these cells often come from the skin or other tissues and contain the pet's complete genetic information. Usually, these cells come from the skin and are called fibroblasts.`,
      },
      step2: {
        title: 'Nuclear Transfer',
        subtitle: `The nucleus, which houses DNA, is removed from the somatic cell. An egg cell is taken from a donor animal and its nucleus is removed to make room for the somatic cell's nucleus. This egg cell now contains the pet's DNA, essentially becoming a genetic copy.`,
      },
      step3: {
        title: 'Electric Stimulation',
        subtitle:
          'The reconstructed egg, with the new nucleus, is stimulated with an electric current or chemicals, which encourages it to divide and become an embryo, just as it would if fertilization had occurred naturally.',
      },
      step4: {
        title: 'Embryo Development',
        subtitle:
          'This embryo is then allowed to develop into a blastocyst - an early stage of development that is suitable for implantation into a surrogate mother. At this stage, the cloning process is the same as for In-Vitro fecondation process.',
      },
      step5: {
        title: 'Implantation and Pregnancy',
        subtitle: `The developed blastocyst is implanted into the surrogate's womb, where it continues to grow. If the implantation is successful, the surrogate becomes pregnant.`,
      },
      step6: {
        title: 'Birth',
        subtitle: `The surrogate carries the pregnancy to term 
          and gives birth to the cloned pet.`,
      },
      conclusion: `Each cloned animal is a genetic duplicate of the original pet, meaning they share the same DNA. However, it's important to note that while the cloned pet, just like identical twins, will look very similar to the original, they may not act identically, as environment and upbringing also shape behaviuor and personality.`,
    },
    section2: {
      title: 'History of Pet Cloning',
      subtitle: `The history of pet cloning cannot be told without acknowledging the iconic sheep named Dolly. Born in 1996 at the Roslin Institute in Scotland, Dolly was the first mammal to be cloned from an adult somatic cell using nuclear transfer technology. Her successful creation demonstrated that specialized cells could be reprogrammed to create an entire organism, a discovery that broke scientific ground and launched the potential for cloning animals.
      Post-Dolly, the technology has made remarkable strides.`,

    title: 'Q&A',
    q1: {
      title: 'What exactly is pet cloning?',
      subtitle: `A: Pet cloning is the process of creating a 
      genetically identical copy of an animal. This is 
      achieved by taking a skin sample from the 
      original animal (the donor), creating cultured 
      cells, and then transferring the genetic material 
      from those cells into an egg cell that has had its 
      nucleus removed.`,
    },
    q2: {
      title: `How much does it cost to clone a 
      pet?`,
      subtitle: `A: Cloning costs can be substantial, reflecting 
      the complex science involved. Currently, cloning 
      a cat or dog can cost around €50,000, while a 
      horse may cost up to €85,000.`,
    },
    q3: {
      title: `What do I need to do if my pet has 
      just died and I'm considering 
      cloning?`,
      subtitle: `A: It's crucial to prevent the body or any tissue 
      from freezing and keep it refrigerated instead. 
      Contact a veterinarian immediately to collect a 
      tissue sample in a sterile medium, and then get 
      in touch with us for further instructions on 
      storage and transportation.`,
    },
    q4: {
      title: `Can I clone an animal that has 
      been deceased for a long time?`,
      subtitle: `A: Successful cloning requires a high-quality 
      genetic sample. Once an animal has been 
      deceased for an extended period, the DNA 
      degradation makes cloning less likely. It's best to 
      begin the process as soon as possible after 
      death. Usually, if the pet has been dead for a 
      week or more and not conserved at 4 degree, it 
      cannot be cloned. If conserved at 4 degree right 
      after death, a pet can be cloned up to 3 weeks 
      after death.`,
    },
    q5: {
      title: `Why shouldn't I freeze my pet's 
      body if I want to clone it? `,
      subtitle: `A: Freezing can damage the cell structure and 
      the DNA inside, which is necessary for cloning. 
      Keeping the sample refrigerated preserves the 
      cells and DNA integrity, increasing the chances 
      of successful cloning.`,
    },
    q6: {
      title: `Can I clone my pet from a hair 
      sample?`,
      subtitle: `A: No, there are no method of cloning from a 
      hair. DNA alone is not enough for cloning 
      because cloning requires nucleus transfer so 
      live cells (usually from skin) are required.`,
    },
    q7: {
      title: `Can my cloned pet have the same 
      personality as my original pet?`,
      subtitle: `A: While a cloned pet will have the same genetic 
      makeup as your original pet, personality traits 
      are influenced by both genetics and 
      environment. Therefore, the cloned animal may 
      have similar predispositions but will develop its 
      own unique personality through its individual 
      experiences.`,

    },
    q9: {
      title: `What is the success rate for pet

    q11: {
      title: 'Is pet cloning legal in Europe?',
      subtitle: `A: in EU, only cloning of animals for consumption 
      such as cattle is regulated. Pet cloning is not 
      defined as illegal by EU. Each European country 
      may have different regulation on the topic but 
      for most of them there is simply no regulation. 
      Cloning of a pet abroad and getting it back to 
      your country would be without any legal
