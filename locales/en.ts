    section1: {
      title: `Welcome to the possibility of pet cloning — a scientific achievement that allows pet owners to consider a future with a part of their current pet's legacy.`,
      subtitle: `In essence, pet cloning is the creation of a new pet with the same genetic makeup as the original. It's real, accessible, and done with attention to 
health and detail.

The idea of having the same pet may sound like a dream, but it's an option available today. 

While the costs reflect the sophisticated process, with €50,000 for cats and dogs and €85,000 for horses, it's a consideration for those who find 
their pet's presence irreplaceable.

On this platform, we provide insights into pet cloning, from how it works to what it involves financially and emotionally. 

If you're curious or seriously thinking about cloning your pet, here you'll find straightforward, informative guidance on the steps and decisions 
involved in making cloning a reality.`,

      title: 'Why Cloning Your Pet?',
      subtitle: `Choosing to clone a pet is a personal and often emotionally driven decision. It reflects a desire to maintain a physical bond beyond a pet's lifespan, coupled with an appreciation for the advances in science that make this possible. 
      Below are some reasons that pet owners consider cloning.`,
      point1: {
        title: 'Continuing the Bond',
        subtitle: `For many, pets are more than animals — they're family members. Cloning allows owners to retain a genetic continuation of their beloved pets, even though their original pet's personality and quirks are unique to each individual's
        life experience.`,
      },
      point2: {
        title: 'Valued Characteristics',
        subtitle: `Certain pets possess exceptional characteristics, whether it's their hereditary lineage, rare breed qualities, or competition-winning abilities. Cloning enables the preservation of these valuable genetic traits, particularly for award-winning racehorses, show dogs, or rare breeds.`,
      },
      point3: {
        title: 'Advances in Science',
        subtitle: `The technology behind pet cloning is a testament to the progress in genetic science. It's a field that continues to grow and fascinate, providing insights into genetic preservation and reproduction.`,
      },

    section3: {
      title: 'Steps of Pet Cloning',
      subtitle: `If you are considering cloning your pet, it involves a series of scientific steps that ensure a new pet with the same genetic makeup as your original companion. Here's a streamlined overview of how the process typically works.`,
      step1: {
        title: 'Tissue Sample Collection',
        subtitle: `It starts with collecting a tissue sample from your pet. This is usually a skin sample, taken under a veterinarian's supervision, to ensure the cells are viable for cloning.`,
      },
      step2: {
        title: 'Cell Culturing',
        subtitle: `The collected cells are then sent to a cloning facility, where they are cultured to grow and multiply, creating a stable line of your pet's genetic material. The cells are then sent to a cloning facility.`,
      },
      step3: {
        title: 'Egg Donor and Transfer',
        subtitle: `The next step involves obtaining an egg from a donor animal. The genetic material of this egg is replaced with the DNA from your pet's cultured cells.`,
      },
      step4: {
        title: 'Embryo Development',
        subtitle:
          'Once the genetic material is transferred, the egg begins to develop into an embryo in a controlled laboratory environment, simulating natural development.',
      },
      step5: {
        title: 'Surrogate and Birth',
        subtitle:
          'The embryo is then implanted into a surrogate mother, where it will grow until birth. This step is critical and is performed with careful monitoring to ensure the health and safety of both the surrogate and the developing clone.',
      },
      step6: {
        title: 'Bringing Your Clone Home',
        subtitle:
          'After the cloned pet is born and weaned, arrangements are made for the new pet to be transported to your home.',
      },
    },
    section4: {
      text: `While the process is scientifically complex, the goal is 
simple: to provide pet owners with the opportunity to
extend the bond they have with their pets. 

Cloning doesn't replace the pet you lost but offers a 
unique way to bring a part of them into the future with 
you. 
      
Each step is carried out with precision, care, and 
respect for the lives involved in this remarkable 
journey.`,
